# Quaternary-Calculator-11
Base 4 calculator

![Application screenshot](https://github.com/Jcarth3w/Quaternary-Calculator-11/blob/main/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

# How to Use
To input a number, click on the buttons labelled 0 through 3.

To perform a unary operation (e.g. square root), input the operand and
then click the desired operation button. The display will update to
show the result.

To perform a binary operation (e.g. addition, subtraction, etc.),
input the first operand and then click the desired operation button.
The display will clear itself; now enter the second operand, then click
on the "=" button. The display will update to show the result.

Binary operations may be "chained;" that is, after entering the second
operand, you may press another operation button. The result will be
computed and stored internally, and you may input an additional
operand.

To clear all previously entered operations, press the button labelled "c."

To toggle the display between quaternary and decimal, press the button
labelled "toggle." Note that numbers may only be entered in quaternary;
if an operation button is pressed while a decimal number is being displayed,
the number will be converted back to quaternary automatically.
